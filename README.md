## App Setup

After `fork`ing and `clone`ing the app, run `bundle`
```

```
This will set up the Sinatra gem.

Then to run the server, in terminal run the main file script
```
$ ruby app.rb
```

In the browser, go to
```
http://localhost:4567/name_form
```

To stop the server and exit the app,
```
ctrl c
```
